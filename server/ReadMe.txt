    to see the layout of the website, because these browsers are the most popular browsers and will 
    cover the majority of the users accessing this web page. Should also test the code out on

Report of the Code (/server):
    - REST benefits this app in the way of providing flexibility in data format, both to the server and 
    from the server. It is not constrained to a certain format, and in this case, it can return the 
    content in simple JSON without complicated processes of parsing involved. It provides convenience 
    and ease for developers in terms of no requirement to install libraries or other software, and it 
    takes advantage of HTTP protocol to send data back and forth.
